# Compression functions

Trying to refresh my memory and learn more about compression techniques, I decided to write them 
down and see how it works.

So far I implemented the JPEG image compression (though didn't add the Huffman coding yet), and 
an interesting new lossless compression called [The Quite OK](https://qoiformat.org/) image compression.
The next are PNG and H264, and then some more basic text compressions.

The idea right now is just to get the compressions to work, so I can understand and play around
with them. 

They are not implemented here to be fast (and using python certainly doesn't help). However,
if you read this and have suggestions how to make them faster, while keeping it readable, please
let me know!

I do intend in the future to create some notebooks explaining these compressions, so let me know
if you are interested in any of them.
